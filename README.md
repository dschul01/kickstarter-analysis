# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends driving the success of campaigns.
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The client, Louise, began a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of $10,000 to fund her play, “Fever”, and was close to meeting the goal in a short amount of time.  She is interested in the success rates for Kickstarter campaigns and would like to understand how funding goals and launch dates impact them.  The purpose of the project is to utilize Excel to determine the success rates based on factors including launch dates, funding goals, as well as type and location.  The project analyzed > 4,000 campaigns across multiple categories and countries from 2009 – 2017 to provide guidance on success.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The original Kickstarter campaign data was utilized to determine if the launch month impacts success.  An additional column was created within the original “Kickstarter” sheet to provide the ability to look at individual years to determine if YoY trends exist.  A pivot table was created to summarize outcome of campaigns based on category and launch month with a filter for “Campaign Category” and “Year”.   Since the purpose is to analyze results of campaigns that have ended, the pivot table was filtered further to remove volumes of “live” campaigns.  
The pivot table was utilized to create the line chart below to illustrate the campaign outcomes based on launch date of theater campaigns.  Observations of the data follows:
* More successful campaigns started between the months of May through July although volumes decrease almost every month after the May peak.  
* Failed campaigns follow a similar trendline as successful campaigns but not to the same degree.
* Canceled campaigns are flat indicating campaign start does not influence this outcome.
* Decisive evidence correlating campaign start month to outcome can not be made from this chart alone 
 
Conclusions and limitations are discussed later in this evaluation.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
### Conclusions

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
### Limitations of the Dataset
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
