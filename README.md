# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends driving the success of campaigns.
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The client, Louise, began a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of $10,000 to fund her play, “Fever”, and was close to meeting the goal in a short amount of time.  She is interested in the success rates for Kickstarter campaigns and would like to understand how funding goals and launch dates impact them.  The purpose of the project is to utilize Excel to determine the success rates based on factors including launch dates, funding goals, as well as type and location.  The project analyzed > 4,000 campaigns across multiple categories and countries from 2009 – 2017 to provide guidance on success.
